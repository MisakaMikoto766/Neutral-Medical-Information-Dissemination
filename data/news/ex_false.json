Contraindications for limb-sparing surgery include major nerve or blood vessel involvement around the tumor; pathological fractures occurring before definitive surgery or during preoperative chemotherapy, where tumor tissue and cells breach the compartment barrier and extensively invade adjacent normal tissue; poor soft tissue conditions around the tumor, such as major muscle groups being removed, scarring due to radiotherapy or multiple surgeries, or skin and soft tissue infections; and improper incisional biopsy that contaminates surrounding normal tissue or leads to poor elasticity and blood supply around the incision scar. For late-stage patients with extensive destruction and malignant bone tumors that are unresponsive to other adjuvant treatments (stage IIB), amputation remains an important and effective method to relieve patient suffering.

Mid-stage symptoms include eating obstruction, post-meal vomiting, weight loss, upper abdominal pain, and low fever, with additional symptoms of anemia, anorexia, fatigue, palpable lumps in the upper abdomen, and tenderness; upper abdominal pain is typically related to eating and primarily located in the upper and left upper abdomen. Late-stage symptoms include difficulty eating, with severe cases limited to consuming liquid diets, intensified upper abdominal pain, hematemesis, melena, and cachexia. Melena generally indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding, though certain foods and medications can also cause black stools. However, tar-like stools are mainly seen in upper gastrointestinal bleeding, appearing black, shiny, often sticky, but odorless.",

    "field": "treatments",
    "source_text": "Testicular cancer is generally treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Surgical treatment involves a radical orchiectomy via an inguinal approach, followed by selecting subsequent treatment methods based on the tumor's histological type and clinical stage. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is performed when some non-seminomatous tumors (such as teratomas of embryonal carcinoma) have metastasized at the initial diagnosis. In addition to radical orchiectomy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection should be conducted along with chemotherapy. Current international guidelines recommend bilateral retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, which can be performed via open or minimally invasive surgery. In robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery, its flexibility and stability surpass the limits of human hands, making it suitable for delicate operations in confined spaces within the body.",
