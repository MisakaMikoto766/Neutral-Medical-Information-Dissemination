Patients who undergo penile-preserving surgery, laser treatment, or radiation therapy can retain standing urination and sexual function, while those who undergo total penile resection cannot retain sexual function. How effective is the treatment for penile cancer? The treatment effect is relatively good. The malignancy level of penile cancer is relatively low, and early treatment is effective.",
